* Based heavily on the javascript source code written by Ivan Kuckir:
** http://blog.ivank.net/voronoi-diagram-in-javascript.html
* This library is not 100% functional yet.  The nuanced differences between javascript & python haven't yet been worked out.
** Run generatorTest.py to see it in action.
* Don't generate any sites that share a y value in order to avoid problems
** (division by zero in various calculations)
* requires pygame in order to rendering example diagrams.  This reliance will be removed once the library's finished.
* I wrote this for Python 2.7.  It's untested on other versions.
** get pygame from www.pygame.org or if you're on Ubuntu:
*** sudo apt-get install python-pygame
